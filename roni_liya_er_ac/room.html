            Beneath the moonlight, I danced alone again tonight.
            The evening was quiet, and the hall felt empty without him.
            My maid whispered secrets, but none I wished to hear.
            I longed for the melody that once filled the ivory room.
            Nothing feels as real as those silent promises.
            The scent of roses faded, leaving only dust and doubt.
            
            Tomorrow brings another chance—or another goodbye.
            I placed his letter inside the golden box, where hope still lingers.
            Everything in me wants to believe he’ll return.
            The mirror reflected more than my mask tonight.
            My fingers trembled as I touched the cold image.
            Remember, I told myself, remember what you must forget.
            Real truth hides in plain sight.
            Only silence knows what lies out of view.
            And still, I stand before the reflection… waiting.
