            After Noa discovers the company's plan to destroy everything,<br>
            Moti sighs and says in a weak voice:<br>
            "There is only one way to save the trees... a secret, ancient way, preserved for generations.<br>
            When the wise trees realized that humans were destroying the forests,<br>
            they sent a message into space. They created a group called <b>'The Guardians of the Forest'</b> -
            intelligent beings, part human, part tree, who orbit the Earth in a hidden spaceship, waiting for the day
            they can return and restore nature.<br>
            Only with a secret code - carefully protected - can you send them an emergency message.<br>
            <b>The Guardians of the Forest: 🌳✨</b><br>
            are an ancient group of explorers, ecologists, and forest spirits 🌲🧙‍♂️
            who formed a bond with the trees hundreds of years ago.<br>
            They live aboard a spaceship called “The Eden” 🚀🌌
            which orbits the Earth in a constant path above the planet 🌍🔄.
            Each of them represents an ancient tree species.<br>
            <b>Their mission:</b>
            to protect the balance of nature 🌱⚖️
            and return only when there is hope to restore the forests
            <b>Your mission:</b> Solve all the riddles, find the secret code, and activate the spaceship signal.<br>
            If you succeed - you will see the rocket take off with Moti to meet the Guardians and save planet Earth 🌍🚀
